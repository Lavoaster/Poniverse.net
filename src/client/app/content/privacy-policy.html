    <h1 ng-hide="hideTosHeader">Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our online
        information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.</p>

    <h3>Log files</h3>
    <p>Log files are maintained for all requests to Poniverse's web servers. These log files capture your IP address, but
        no personal information. Just about every website collects logs like these, and they're used for statistical and
        diagnostic purposes.</p>

    <h3>Our Commitment to Children's Privacy</h3>
    <p>Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never knowingly collect
        personal information at Poniverse from those under 13, and no part of our services is structured to attract anyone
        under 13.</p>

    <h3>Cookies</h3>
    <p>Poniverse does not, without your permission, store any information that would, on its own, allow us to identify you
        or other individual users of our services. We do use cookies to maintain your sessions, track user preferences, and
        otherwise enhance the user experience. Using Poniverse's services means you consent to our use of cookies. You may
        opt out of this by adjusting your browser's cookie settings.</p>

    <p>We also use advertisements and other third-party services to support our services. Some advertisers may use
        technology such as cookies and web beacons when they advertise on our site, which will also send these advertisers
        (such as Google through the Google AdSense program) information including your IP address, your ISP, the browser
        you used to visit our site, and in some cases,  whether you have Flash installed. This is generally used for
        geotargeting purposes (showing New York real estate ads to someone in New York, for example) or showing certain
        ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking sites).</p>

    <h3>DoubleClick DART cookies</h3>
    <p>We may also use DART cookies for ad serving through Google’s DoubleClick, which places a cookie on your computer
        when you are browsing the web and visit a site using DoubleClick advertising (including some Google AdSense
        advertisements). This cookie is used to serve ads specific to you and your interests (”interest based targeting”).</p>

    <p>The ads served will be targeted based on your previous browsing history (For example, if you have been
        viewing sites about visiting Las Vegas, you may see Las Vegas hotel advertisements when viewing a non-related site,
        such as on a site about hockey). DART uses “non personally identifiable information”. It does NOT track personal
        information about you, such as your name, email address, physical address, telephone number, social security
        numbers, bank account numbers or credit card numbers.</p>
    <p>You can opt-out of this ad serving on all sites using this advertising by visiting Google's
        <a href="https://www.google.com/ads/preferences/" target="_blank">Ad Settings</a> page.</p>
