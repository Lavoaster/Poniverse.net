    <p>You must be 13 years of age or older to hold a Poniverse account.</p>
    <p>Creating/holding multiple Poniverse accounts is forbidden. Doing so to get a new name is not a valid excuse - you can change your public display name on Poniverse&#39;s services.</p>
    <p>A Poniverse account may only be used by the individual who created it.</p>
    <p>Users are responsible for ALL activities that occur under their accounts.</p>

    <p>All content is subject to moderation by Poniverse staff.</p>

    <h3>Section 2 - Punitive Actions</h3>
    <p>Punitive actions may differ among Poniverse services. Please check with the individual services for punitive policies specific to them.</p>
    <p>Bans from one service do not automatically propagate to Poniverse’s other services. However, member history from one Poniverse service may be used to make a moderative decision on another.</p>
    <p>Poniverse reserves the right to remove any user-posted content from its services at any time, for any reason, with or without notice to its author.</p>
    <p>Poniverse reserves the right to suspend a member&#39;s access to any or all of Poniverse’s services at any time, for any reason, and for any length of time, with or without notice to the member.</p>

    <h3>Section 3 - Moderation Disputes</h3>
    <p>Because we recognize that no one is perfect, including our own staff, we provide channels for members to dispute moderative actions taken against them.</p>
    <p>Moderation disputes are handled on a best-effort basis. Opening a dispute provides no guarantee whatsoever that actions taken against you will be reversed. Poniverse staff always have the final say.</p>
    <p>All disputes are handled privately.</p>
    <p>Failure to maintain the confidentiality of your dispute may invalidate your dispute and lead to further punitive action, as deemed appropriate solely by Poniverse.</p>

    <h3>Section 4 - Terms of Service Updates</h3>
    <p>Poniverse may update the TOS at any time, at its sole discretion.</p>
    <p>Any changes to the TOS will become effective 7 days after their implementation.</p>
